This package is the final project of my class.

I have tried to add as much functionalities as I can, and they work very well. 

All functions are well documented.

For the requirement.txt, it is quite possible that packages with lower versions could also work.

Good luck with the research.




Steps to install:

(3)Enter and run: python setup.py build

(4)Enter and run: python setup.py install
